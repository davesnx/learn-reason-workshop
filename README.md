# Introduction

Reason is a language that looks and reads like Javascript, writes like Javascript, and even interops nicely with Javascript. But it is in fact a new syntax for OCaml, a powerful statically typed functional programming language.

The syntax makes ReasonML easy to start playing with, but unless you already know a typed functional language, you will soon run into stumbling blocks because of unfamiliarity with static types and functional programming.

Fear not! Work through these exercises and learn all the basics - defining and using functions, understanding recursion, lists, list operations, variants, and all the way till mutable variables. They will give you a great foundation to start mastering this beautiful language.

# Setting Up

Prerequisite: either NPM or Yarn.

1. Install `bs-platform`:
  ```
  yarn add bs-platform
  # or npm install bs-platform
  ```

2. Setup your editor.
  - `VSCode` along with [reason-language-server](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server) extension.
  - `Sublime` with [sublime-reason](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/sublime-reason)
  - `vim` with [vim-reason-plus](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vim-reason-plus)

  If you prefer a different editor check the instructions for [other supported editors](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/editor-plugins.html)

# Workflow

The exercises are numerically ordered and can be found in the `src/exercises` directory.

Start by opening the first exercise in a text editor - `src/exercises/01-introduction/introduction.re`. It will tell you where to go from there.

All exercises except the first one comes with a test. Run them as you complete each exercise. For example for the second exercise, run its test with:

  ```
  node src/exercises/02-basic_types/basicTypes.bs.js
  ```

This `.bs.js` file is your Reason program (`.re`) compiled to Javascript. `.bs` stands for the [bucklescript compiler](https://bucklescript.github.io/). The `.bs.js` code is readable Javascript - give them a look if you're curious!

You can also run `./run_tests` which will run all the tests automatically for you and stop at the first failing one.

# Support

Please feel free to raise an issue if you have any questions as you work through the exercises. You can also find help in the [Reason Discord channel](https://discord.gg/reasonml), or in the [Reason Discourse forum](https://reasonml.chat/).
